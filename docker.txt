1) sudo su

2) yum install docker -y    (install the docker in your linux machine)

3) which docker         (where exactly the docker is insalled . we use it generally to see if software is installed properly)

4) service docker start   (this will start the docker service)

5) service docker status   (to cross check if you docker is started or not . if it is active it means it is started)

6) docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash    (this will create a container with ubuntu image. now since ubuntu image is not there in docker engine first it will 
                                       pull from docker hub and put it in docker engine and then create container)

7) docker images    (list of all the images in docker engine) 

8) docker ps -a    (list of all the containers)

9) docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash    (this will create container but since ubuntu image is already there it will not pull it from docker hub it will take from engine)

10) docker images    (only ubuntu image is there)

11) docker ps -a   (2 containers are there with 2 different random names)

12) docker run -it --name akshat ubuntu /bin/bash   (this will create a new container with image ubuntu and name akshat)

13) docker ps -a    (to list all the containers)

########################## START AND ENTER IN EXISTING CONTAINER #######################################


14) docker ps -a    (copy the container id which you need to start)
 
15) docker start <<container id>>    (start the container)  (in place of container id ,name of container can also be used)

16) docker attach <<container id>>>    (get inside the container)

17) docker rm <<container name>>   (delete container)

###################CREATE A CONTAINER FROM IMAGE OF ANOTHER CONTAINER #########################################

There is a container -> edureka container (ubuntu)
i have created 2 files in that... touch file1 file2
now i want to create another container (testcontainer2) with the same 2 files.....
what i will do ?

-> image from the edureka container 
-> use that image to create testcontainer2  
-> now the testcontainer2 will also contain file1 and file2


18) docker run -it --name edureka ubuntu /bin/bash     (creating a new container with edureka name)

19) touch file2 file3 file4     (these files are created in edureka container)

20) exit

21) docker commit edureka eduimagebyakshat        (so here the image with the name eduimagebyakshat would be created from edureka container)

22) docker images   (you will eduimagebyakshat there which means the image is created successfully)

23) docker run -it --name testcontainer2 eduimagebyakshat /bin/bash    (creating a new container with the image eduimagebyakshat)

24) ls   (you will see file2 file3 file4 created. which means a new container with the content of edureka container is created)


25) exit

26) docker ps -a    (you  will edureka and testcontainer2 there which means we are not updating we are a new container with the image of a particular container)
